# Data Exploration and Visualization with Tableau Public

This repository contains the code, data, and report for a data exploration and visualization project focusing on a survey of the frog population in the state of Victoria, Australia. The project explores the data set and identifies irregularities, followed by an analysis of when different types of frogs were observed, along with the type of observation.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to analyze the given dataset, find any irregularities, and visualize the data using Tableau Public. The dataset contains observations of frogs from the years 2000-2018 CE, including details about when, where, and how the frogs were sighted, as well as their types.

## Files in the Repository
- `PE1_Parashar_31940757.pdf`: The report detailing the data exploration process, the irregularities found, and the analysis performed.
- `FIT5147_S1_2023_PE1_Description.pdf`: The project description and guidelines, including instructions for the assignment, submission requirements, and assessment criteria.

## Instructions for the Project
To run the project:
1. Load the provided dataset in Tableau Public or Desktop.
2. Use Tableau to visualize the data and identify any irregularities.
3. Correct the irregularities and proceed with the data exploration.
4. Answer the provided questions and create visualizations to support your analysis.

## Data Irregularities
Three types of irregularities or errors were identified and corrected during the data exploration process:
1. **Geographic Location**: An observation was found near the United States of America, which is not within the Port Phillip and Westernport CMA Region.
2. **Timeline**: Two records were dated 1916, outside the study timeline.
3. **Spelling Errors**: Spelling mistakes in the "Common name" field.

## Analysis
After correcting the irregularities, the following questions were addressed:
- **Q1**: Compare and contrast when different types of frogs were observed on an hourly and monthly timescale. What does this suggest about the behavior of the researchers or the frogs?
- **Q2**: Compare and contrast the "Type of Observation" used to gather the data. How does this variable support, challenge, or change your conclusions to the first question?

## Visualizations
Various visualizations were used to explore and understand the dataset. These include side-by-side area curves, line graphs, and tabular data representations.

## Submission and Assessment
- The report must be submitted as a PDF file with a maximum of 5 pages, including figures, with a minimum font size of 10.
- The assessment criteria include the ability to check and clean data, explore data visually, see trends and patterns, and the quality of the report.
